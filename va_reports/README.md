# SAS Visual Analytics Reports

## Overview
This folder contains the SAS Visual Analytics report templates for the two reports used in the app. This is optional, if you want to create your own Visual Analytics Reports.

## Installation
Download the .txt files from this folder and save them in a convenient location on your system.

## Usage
When you create a new [SAS Visual Analytics](https://go.documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=vacdc&cdcVersion=8.5&docsetId=vaov&docsetTarget=titlepage.htm&locale=en "SAS Visual Analytics") report, simply press Ctrl+Alt+B on the report area. You will then be prompted to load and save XML or JSON file. Select XML and load the .txt files in this folder. You would need to do this twice, once for the input report and once for the output report. For the output report, you must enable it to refresh the report data every 2 or 3 seconds.
